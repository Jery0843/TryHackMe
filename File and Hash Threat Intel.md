## Room: https://tryhackme.com/room/fileandhashthreatintel
## Introduction

**File and Hash Threat Intel** is a beginner-friendly blue team challenge on TryHackMe designed for SOC analysts and cybersecurity learners. This room teaches practical skills in malware detection, hash analysis, and threat intelligence workflows by simulating real-world scenarios where attackers disguise malicious files using misleading names and extensions.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this walkthrough, you will learn to:
- Detect suspicious file naming conventions and double extensions used for masquerading malware
- Extract and analyze file hashes using PowerShell and CMD on Windows systems  
- Use VirusTotal and MalwareBazaar to classify threats and identify MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Perform sandbox analysis with Hybrid Analysis to uncover stealthy behaviors
- Apply these techniques to real-world SOC workflows for incident response

## Prerequisites

- Access to the TryHackMe File and Hash Threat Intel room
- Basic understanding of Windows command line
- Familiarity with threat intelligence concepts

---

## Task 1: Introduction (No Questions)

Read through the introduction material about the scenario. You are an L1 analyst who must analyze suspicious binaries flagged by EDR tools and determine if they are benign or malicious within 60 minutes.

---

## Task 2: Filenames and Paths

### Objective
Learn to identify suspicious file naming indicators that malware uses to evade detection.

### Key Concepts
- **Double extensions**: Files like `payroll.pdf.exe` where attackers append legitimate extensions before executable extensions
- **System binary impersonation**: Malware named to look like legitimate Windows files
- **Misleading names**: Files with names designed to appear harmless

### Question & Answer

**Q1:** One file displays one of the indicators mentioned. Can you identify the file and the indicator? (Answer: file, property)

**Answer:** `payroll.pdf, Double extensions`

**Explanation:** Looking at the files in the CTI folder on the desktop, you'll find `payroll.pdf.exe` which uses a double extension technique - a common evasion method where malware appears to be a PDF document but is actually an executable file.
