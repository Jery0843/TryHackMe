## Room : https://tryhackme.com/room/malwareclassification

Once upon a time in SOC land, I was handed the keys to a dashboard glowing red with alerts. My mission? **Classify malware** like a true cyber-detective and prove my worth. Spoiler: it was a ride full of pop-ups, encrypted chaos, and shady processes wearing fake names.

## 🗂️ Task 1 – Introduction  
The story began with a warmup. Malware isn’t just evil software; it’s like a toolbox for chaos: stealing secrets, wrecking systems, or popping ads in your face.  
The SOC analyst’s role? Spot it, name it, stop it. Simple enough… until you see “system_update.exe” doing creepy things.  

**Answer:** *No answer needed* ✅

## 🧩 Task 2 – Malware Types  
I was introduced to the “villains gallery” — each malware type with its own evil personality:  
- Adware: the annoying cousin who spams pop-ups.  
- Spyware: the stalker hiding behind the curtains.  
- Ransomware: the extortionist with a padlock.  
- Wiper: the psycho who deletes everything.  
- C2/RAT: the puppet master.  
- Data Stealer: the kleptomaniac.  
- Keylogger: the nosy typist watcher.  
- Cryptominer: the electricity thief.  

**Q&A:**  
- High CPU, system slow → `cryptominer` ✅  
- Files locked + ransom note → `ransomware` ✅  
- Browser spams pop-ups → `adware` ✅  
- Leaked internal documents → `data stealer` ✅

## 🌍 Task 3 – Real-World Examples  
This was where the villains got famous names:  
- **Pegasus** – the spyware spy of governments.  
- **Akira** – ransomware with a double-extortion hobby.  
- **Shamoon** – wiper that nuked oil company networks.  
- **Agent Tesla** – the sneaky infostealer.  
- **RedLine Stealer** – keylogger + data thief hybrid.  
- **QakBot** – the RAT that just won’t die.  

**Q&A:**  
- Logs keystrokes + screenshots → `Agent Tesla` ✅  
- Zero-click spyware on phones → `Pegasus` ✅  
- Ransomware stealing + leaking → `Akira` ✅  
- Nuked Saudi Aramco → `Shamoon` ✅

## 💻 Task 4 – Binary vs Script Malware  
Here came the hacker’s toolkit showdown:  
- **Binary Malware:** solid, heavy, compiled executables (.exe, .bat, etc.) — hard to change but easier to fingerprint.  
- **Script Malware:** sneaky, lightweight, written in scripting languages — flexible and easily obfuscated.  

We even saw a **LummaStealer** example dropping payloads straight into memory, avoiding disk like a ninja.  

**Q&A:**  
- Script malware’s favorite downloader → `PowerShell` ✅  
- Another Windows executable extension → `.bat` ✅  
- Leaves byte patterns for AV detection → `Binaries` ✅

## 🕵️ Task 5 – Practical SOC Analyst Roleplay  
Now it got cinematic: I sat in the SOC, alerts pouring in. One by one, I classified them:  

1. `ads_service.exe` with pop-ups → **Adware**  
2. `system_update.exe` stealing clipboard/email data → **Spyware**  
3. Mass `.encrypted` files + ransom note → **Ransomware**  
4. `disk_cleaner.exe` nuking backups → **Wiper**  
5. `svchost32.exe` beaconing to C2 → **Trojan (RAT)**  
6. `docu_manager.exe` stealing sensitive files → **Data Stealer**  
7. DLL injection in `winlogon.exe` capturing keys → **Keylogger**  
8. `svcupdate.exe` hogging CPU for mining → **Cryptominer**  

**Flag:**  
`THM{Malwar3_****************}` ✅

## 🎯 Task 6 – Conclusion  
Mission complete. After 45 minutes of digital detective work, I walked away knowing:  
- Malware has many faces, from noisy adware to destructive wipers.  
- Binaries leave fingerprints, scripts morph like shapeshifters.  
- SOC analysts survive by **classifying fast** and acting smart.  

**Answer:** *No answer needed* ✅

# 🚀 Final Thoughts  
This room was like joining CSI: Cyber, but with fewer neon lights and more packet captures. If you want to sharpen your instincts as a SOC analyst, this one’s a must-try.
