##  Task 2: Hacking Your First Machine

### Step 1: Start the Machine

Launch the VM for the FakeBank application and open the browser and terminal interface.

### Step 2: Open the Terminal

On the right side of the interface, click the **Terminal** icon to start typing commands.

### Step 3: Use Gobuster to Discover Hidden Directories

Run:

```bash
gobuster -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt dir
```

- `-u` specifies the target URL (`http://fakebank.thm`)  
- `-w` specifies the wordlist (`wordlist.txt`)  
- `dir` tells Gobuster to use directory brute-forcing mode  

Example output:

```
/images (Status: 301)  
/bank-transfer (Status: 200)  
```

### Step 4: Access the Bank Transfer Page

Navigate to:

```
http://fakebank.thm/bank-transfer
```

This is the hidden admin portal that allows money transfers.

### Step 5: Exploit the Vulnerability

Use the admin interface to transfer **$2000** from account **2276** to **8881**.  
After submitting, you should see a ‚ÄúSuccess, transfer complete‚Äù message.  
Return to your account view to see your updated balance.  
The page will display the room‚Äôs **flag**:

**Flag:** `BANK-HACKED`

### Step 6: Terminate the Machine

Click the red **Terminate** button in the TryHackMe interface to stop the VM.
