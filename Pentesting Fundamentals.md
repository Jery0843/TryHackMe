##  Overview

This introductory room teaches the foundational concepts and ethical framework behind penetration testing (“pentesting”). You’ll learn what pentesting is, the importance of ethics and scope, methodological stages, testing scopes (black, grey, white box), and a practical walkthrough simulating a pentest engagement.

##  Task 1: What Is Penetration Testing?

Penetration testing is the ethical, authorized attempt to find vulnerabilities in systems by mimicking the methods of malicious attackers. It’s akin to a security audit carried out with permission to help strengthen security.

##  Task 2: Penetration Testing Ethics

Before starting any pentest, you and the client define a **Rules of Engagement (ROE)** that outlines:

- **Permission** – Legal authorization to conduct the test  
- **Scope** – What targets and services are allowed  
- **Rules** – Technical boundaries, such as prohibited actions

###  Types of Hackers

| Hacker Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **White Hat** | Ethical pentesters working with authorization |
| **Grey Hat**  | Sometimes beneficial but may breach laws or ethics |
| **Black Hat** | Malicious actors with harmful intent |

**Sample Questions & Answers**  
- Given permission to audit → **White Hat**  
- Theft of data without consent → **Black Hat**  
- Document defining scope and permission → **Rules of Engagement**

##  Task 3: Penetration Testing Methodologies

A pentest methodology typically follows these stages:

1. **Information Gathering** – Collecting public data (OSINT)  
2. **Enumeration/Scanning** – Identifying live hosts, services  
3. **Exploitation** – Using vulnerabilities to gain access  
4. **Privilege Escalation** – Expanding access horizontally or vertically  
5. **Post-Exploitation** – Pivoting, cleanup, reporting  

###  Pentesting Frameworks

| Framework | Focus | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|-------|------|------|
| **OSSTMM** | Networks, telecoms, systems | Very comprehensive | Dense, complex |
| **OWASP**  | Web applications | Easy, actively maintained | No formal accreditation |
| **NIST CSF** | Organizational security posture | Widely used, detailed | General-purpose, not pentest-focused |
| **NCSC CAF** | Critical infrastructure & national frameworks | Government-endorsed | Niche, slower adoption |

**Sample Answers**  
- Public info stage → **Information Gathering**  
- Framework for telecom pentesting → **OSSTMM**  
- Framework for web apps → **OWASP**

##  Task 4: Testing Scopes – Box Types

Scopes define what’s known during testing:

- **Black‑Box**: No internal knowledge, simulates external attacker  
- **Grey‑Box**: Limited internal insight, more informed than Black‑Box  
- **White‑Box**: Full source/config access, detailed internal testing  

**Sample Q&A**  
- No source code → **Black Box**  
- Full source code → **White Box**

##  Task 5: Practical – ACME Penetration Test

Simulated engagement walkthrough—apply all methodology learned to “ACME” infrastructure.  
Upon completion, you receive the flag:  

**Flag:** `THM{PENTEST_COMPLETE}`

##  Summary Table

| Task | Topic | Key Outcome |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | What is Pentesting | Understanding ethical pentesting |
| 2 | Ethics & ROE | Authorized, scoped hacking |
| 3 | Methodologies | From recon to reporting |
| 4 | Box Types | Testing with different knowledge levels |
| 5 | Practical | Simulated audit → `THM{PENTEST_COMPLETE}` |

##  Final Thoughts

This room lays the conceptual groundwork for real-world offensive security. By exploring ethics, structured testing methods, and hands-on simulation, you’re better prepared for more technical pentesting challenges.

##  Tips

- Focus on the *why* behind each stage—not just the steps.  
- Use the ROE concept in every future pentesting task.  
- Understand how different testing scopes affect strategy and preparation.
