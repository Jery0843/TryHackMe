# 🕵️‍♂️ TryHackMe Writeups

Welcome to my **TryHackMe Writeups Vault** — a collection of step-by-step walkthroughs from various rooms on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/).
Each writeup is designed to be **educational, entertaining, and easy to follow**, so learners and pentesters alike can level up their skills. 🚀

## 📚 What’s Inside?

* 🔎 **Recon & Enumeration** — the detective work before the hack
* 💻 **Exploitation** — breaking in with style (and payloads!)
* 📈 **Privilege Escalation** — going from zero → hero
* 🛡️ **Remediation** — because defense is just as important as offense
* ✍️ **Lessons Learned** — key takeaways from each room
